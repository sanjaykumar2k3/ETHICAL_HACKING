# Python Keylogger

## Overview
This is a Python-based keylogger for **educational purposes only**. It demonstrates how keylogging works and sends logged keys via email at regular intervals.

## Features
- Logs every keypress, including special keys.
- Sends email reports with logs at a specified interval.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `pynput` library: Install with `pip install pynput`

## Usage
1. Replace `MAIL` and `APP_PASSWORD` in `sam.py` with your Gmail address and app password.
2. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   sam.py


## Converting Python Scripts to Executables
If you want to use the Python scripts as standalone executables on Windows, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- Install Python 3.x
- Install `pip` if not already installed.
- Install PyInstaller using the command:
  ```bash
  pip install pyinstaller
Steps
Place all Python files (sample_key.py and sam.py) in the same directory.
Open a terminal or command prompt in the directory containing the files.
Run the following commands to create executables:
For sample_key.py:
pyinstaller --onefile sample_key.py
For main.py:
pyinstaller --onefile main.py
The executables will be generated in the dist folder.

Optional
To hide the console window when running the executables (e.g., for the keylogger), use the --noconsole flag:
pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole sam.py
If dependencies are missing, include them explicitly with the --add-data option:
pyinstaller --onefile --add-data "sam.py;." main.py
Testing
After conversion, run the .exe files to ensure all functionalities work as expected.
